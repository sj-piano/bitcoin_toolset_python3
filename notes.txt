Working principles:
- All data values must be strings. Later, can convert them to numeric types if that's useful.
- Leave amounts in satoshi for internal calculations. Convert to bitcoin only when reporting data to user.



My working definition of a standard transaction:
- It has at least one input and at least one output.
- All input and output addresses are Pay-To-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH).
- All input scriptSigs contain uncompressed public keys.
